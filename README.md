# Determining-the-Validity-of-Genetically-Engineered-Crops-in-a-Warming-Climate-Using-Machine-Learning
This project evaluates genetically modified crops' viability against traditional ones and their role in food security and climate change. It analyzes existing data and employs a prototype tool to predict engineered plant success in future environments, aiding genetic manipulation planning.
